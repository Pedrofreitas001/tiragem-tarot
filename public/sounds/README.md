## How to Add Sounds

1. Find or create appropriate sound effects
2. Convert them to MP3 format
3. Place them in this directory with the exact names listed above

## Recommendations

- **shuffle.mp3**: Card shuffling sound (duration: 1-2 seconds)
- **spread.mp3**: Cards being laid out on table (duration: 0.5-1 second)
